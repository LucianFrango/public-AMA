# Ask me (Lucian) anything!

This is a ask-me-anything (AMA) repository for anyone wanting to get in touch. I copied the idea from 
[@mdo](https://github.com/mdo/ama). Amazing way to get rid of traditional blog comments and keep everything within Github, which I like alot now :)

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/lucianfrango/public-AMA/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/lucianfrango/public-AMA/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. I'm [@lucianfrango](https://twitter.com/lucianfrango) on
Twitter.

### LinkedIn
If GitHub or Twitter aren't really your thing, then how about LinkedIn. You can find [my profile here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianfranghiu/).
